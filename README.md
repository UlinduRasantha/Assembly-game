#Overview
-Assembly Endgame is a word-guessing game inspired by the classic game Hangman. Developed as part of Scrimba's course project, the goal is to guess the hidden word within a limited number of attempts while avoiding incorrect guesses. Each incorrect guess "eliminates" a programming language, and the game is over when all languages are lost.

#How to Play
1.A random programming-related word is selected (e.g., react).
2.You start with all programming languages "active."
3.Guess the word one letter at a time by clicking the displayed keyboard buttons.
4.Correct Guesses: Revealed in the hidden word.
5.Incorrect Guesses: A programming language is eliminated.
6.Lose the game if you make too many incorrect guesses.
7.Win the game by correctly guessing all letters in the word.

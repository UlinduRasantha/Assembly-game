#Overview
-Assembly Endgame is a word-guessing game inspired by the classic game Hangman. Developed as part of Scrimba's course project, the goal is to guess the hidden word within a limited number of attempts while avoiding incorrect guesses. Each incorrect guess "eliminates" a programming language, and the game is over when all languages are lost.
